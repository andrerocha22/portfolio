                        Hi! I'm Andre Rocha, I am a computer engineer from
                        Federal University of Itajub√°. I love exploring new
                        technologies and often amazed by the progress we as a
                        human species have made so far in the recent years. But,
                        for me, the most important thing is how the technology
                        make the people's live better
                    </p>
                    <p className="text">
                        About me at university I learned that study is never
                        enough, learn is the key to be a sucessefull developer.
                        In my previous experience this feeling became stronger,
                        I had autonomy over what I was developing acting as a
                        kind of PO, so I was able to use new tools and libraries
                        to build a better product and collected data,
                        encouraging a data-driven culture.
                    </p>

    );
